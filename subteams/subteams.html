        There are 7 main subteams that make up Penn Robotics. Each has their own
        distinct purpose, and without them, Penn wouldn't be able to do the
        things they do.

          On our business subteam, work is primarily concerned with collecting
          funding for our team. This funding allows us to organize a budget and
          forecast the amount that should be spent on our robot, team, and
          community. Annually, around 80,000 dollars is raised on our team to
          put towards manufacturing, wiring, programming and designing a robot
          to compete with; a large portion of the funding also goes towards
          community outreach and helping people in need. Acquiring the funding
          forecasted usually stems from sponsorships, fundraisers, and grants.
          We send letters to local businesses, set up fundraisers like chicken
          sales, and apply for government grants to inch us closer to our set
          goal. At the end of each season, we take a chunk of what’s left, and
          pack it away for a boost in the coming season as well. Our business
          subteam is full of opportunity and allows students to learn the basics
          of business that can be applied in the real world.

            Media’s job is to be the face of our team. In the media subteam, we
            use a variety of skills to present our team to the public in the
            best possible light. These skills include things like taking quality
            pictures, using photoshop, editing videos, and making posts on
            social media.

            Media is responsible for all of the visual content our team puts
            out, so it is crucial that we have a large repository of pictures at
            our disposal at all times. At least one representative from the
            media team should be present at all outreach events so that
            documentation can take place. At an outreach event, some good things
            to take pictures of include:

          Most programming documentation, including downloading software,
          setting up code, basic programming, and information about basic
          connecting parts, can be found on the WPILib website. Linked within
          the WPILib website is the API documentation for your desired
          programming language (Java or C++).

            While manufacturing and software is integral to making the robot
            run, what puts all the components together is in the hands of the
            Wiring Subteam. Our wiring subteam designs and builds the
            electronics and pneumatic components on the robot.

            A barebones kit from FIRST contains the constraints on what the
            electronics can be on the robot, but other than that, everything
            else is for the wiring team to figure out. When first building a
            robot, the wiring system is pre planned on paper to ensure that all
            of the mechanical components are arranged and wired up in the most
            efficient way possible. This subteam uses tools including wire
            crimper, soldering irons, and wire strippers to systemize the wiring
            board.

          Our outreach subteam is dedicated to improving the state of STEM
          education and opportunities for young people in our community through
          FIRST Robotics. From event planning to networking to documenting,
          there are several skills that members of our team develop in running
          outreach events. We strive to make a positive impact on our community
          and keep our team sustainable to guarantee the same quality of work
          for years to come. The biggest ways that we spread FIRST are through
          national conventions such as the ATIA conference, IMTS, and IDEAcon,
          as well as youth camps such as our 8+ summer camps and fall and winter
          workshops we host throughout the year. Feel free to reference the
          Outreach section of our website to see all the ways that we promote
          STEM and FIRST.
