        There are 7 main subteams that make up Penn Robotics. Each has their own
        distinct purpose, and without them, Penn wouldn't be able to do the
        things they do.

        On our business subteam, work is primarily concerned with collecting
        funding for our team. This funding allows us to organize a budget and
        forecast the amount that should be spent on our robot, team, and
        community. Annually, around 80,000 dollars is raised on our team to put
        towards manufacturing, wiring, programming and designing a robot to
        compete with; a large portion of the funding also goes towards community
        outreach and helping people in need. Acquiring the funding forecasted
        usually stems from sponsorships, fundraisers, and grants. We send
        letters to local businesses, set up fundraisers like chicken sales, and
        apply for government grants to inch us closer to our set goal. At the
        end of each season, we take a chunk of what’s left, and pack it away for
        a boost in the coming season as well. Our business subteam is full of
        opportunity and allows students to learn the basics of business that can
        be applied in the real world.

            Media’s job is to be the face of our team. In the media subteam, we
            use a variety of skills to present our team to the public in the
            best possible light. These skills include things like taking quality
            pictures, using photoshop, editing videos, and making posts on
            social media.

          Media is responsible for all of the visual content our team puts out,
          so it is crucial that we have a large repository of pictures at our
          disposal at all times. At least one representative from the media team
          should be present at all outreach events so that documentation can
          take place. At an outreach event, some good things to take pictures of
          include:

          Photography is also fantastic during meeting times. Some things that

          On our software team, work is split between both programming and
          wiring. Most programming documentation, including downloading
          software, setting up code, basic programming, and information about
          basic connecting parts, can be found on the WPILib website. Linked
          within the WPILib website is the API documentation for your desired
          programming language (Java or C++). Some wiring information is also on
          the previously mentioned WPILib website. Further information conveyed
          internally is in our tribal knowledge slide show.

          Our outreach subteam is dedicated to improving the state of STEM
          education and opportunities for young people in our community through
          FIRST Robotics. From event planning to networking to documenting,
          there are several skills that members of our team develop in running
          outreach events. We strive to make a positive impact on our community
          and keep our team sustainable to guarantee the same quality of work
          for years to come. The biggest ways that we spread FIRST are through
          national conventions such as the ATIA conference, IMTS, and IDEAcon,
          as well as youth camps such as our 8+ summer camps and fall and winter
          workshops we host throughout the year. Feel free to reference the
          Outreach section of our website to see all the ways that we promote
          STEM and FIRST.
