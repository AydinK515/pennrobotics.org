        There are 7 main subteams that make up Penn Robotics. Each has their own
        distinct purpose, and without them, Penn wouldn't be able to do the
        things they do.

            On our business subteam, work is primarily concerned with collecting
            funding for our team. This funding allows us to organize a budget
            and forecast the amount that should be spent on our robot, team, and
            community. Annually, around 80,000 dollars is raised on our team to
            put towards manufacturing, wiring, programming and designing a robot
            to compete with; a large portion of the funding also goes towards
            community outreach and helping people in need. Acquiring the funding
            forecasted usually stems from sponsorships, fundraisers, and grants.
            We send letters to local businesses, set up fundraisers like chicken
            sales, and apply for government grants to inch us closer to our set
            goal. At the end of each season, we take a chunk of what’s left, and
            pack it away for a boost in the coming season as well. Our business
            subteam is full of opportunity and allows students to learn the
            basics of business that can be applied in the real world.

            Media’s job is to be the face of our team. In the media subteam, we
            use a variety of skills to present our team to the public in the
            best possible light. These skills include things like taking quality
            pictures, using photoshop, editing videos, and making posts on
            social media.

            Media is responsible for all of the visual content our team puts
            out, so it is crucial that we have a large repository of pictures at
            our disposal at all times. At least one representative from the
            media team should be present at all outreach events so that
            documentation can take place. At an outreach event, some good things
            to take pictures of include:

          <div class="list">
            <li>Members of our team at the event</li>

            <li>
              Noteworthy landmarks or signs in the area for context in social
              media posts

              Photography is also fantastic during meeting times. Some things
              that would be good to have documented include:
            </p>
            <div class="list">
              <li>Pictures of team members working at desks</li>
              <li>Pictures of team members mentoring FTC teams</li>
              <li>
                Pictures of people working in the machine shop (Be careful, wear
                safety glasses, and let them know what you are doing.
                Distracting someone on heavy machinery can be deadly.)

            On our software team, work is split between both programming and
            wiring. Most programming documentation, including downloading
            software, setting up code, basic programming, and information about
            basic connecting parts, can be found on the WPILib website. Linked
            within the WPILib website is the API documentation for your desired
            programming language (Java or C++). Some wiring information is also
            on the previously mentioned WPILib website. Further information
            conveyed internally is in our tribal knowledge slide show.
