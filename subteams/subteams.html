        There are 7 main subteams that make up Penn Robotics. Each has their own
        distinct purpose, and without them, Penn wouldn't be able to do the
        things they do.

            On our business subteam, work is primarily concerned with collecting
            funding for our team. This funding allows us to organize a budget
            and forecast the amount that should be spent on our robot, team, and
            community. Annually, around 80,000 dollars is raised on our team to
            put towards manufacturing, wiring, programming and designing a robot
            to compete with; a large portion of the funding also goes towards
            community outreach and helping people in need. Acquiring the funding
            forecasted usually stems from sponsorships, fundraisers, and grants.
            We send letters to local businesses, set up fundraisers like chicken
            sales, and apply for government grants to inch us closer to our set
            goal. At the end of each season, we take a chunk of what’s left, and
            pack it away for a boost in the coming season as well. Our business
            subteam is full of opportunity and allows students to learn the
            basics of business that can be applied in the real world.

            Media’s job is to be the face of our team. In the media subteam, we
            use a variety of skills to present our team to the public in the
            best possible light. These skills include things like taking quality
            pictures, using photoshop, editing videos, and making posts on
            social media.

          <p>
            Media is responsible for all of the visual content our team puts
            out, so it is crucial that we have a large repository of pictures at
            our disposal at all times. At least one representative from the
            media team should be present at all outreach events so that
            documentation can take place.

            Most programming documentation, including downloading software,
            setting up code, basic programming, and information about basic
            connecting parts, can be found on the WPILib website. Linked within
            the WPILib website is the API documentation for your desired
            programming language (Java or C++).

            Our programming subteam focuses on taking the robot built by
            manufacturing and design, and getting it to move through complex
            instructions in the form of programming.

            A barebones kit from FIRST contains the constraints on what the
            electronics can be on the robot, but other than that, everything
            else is for the wiring team to figure out. When first building a
            robot, the wiring system is pre planned on paper to ensure that all
            of the mechanical components are arranged and wired up in the most
            efficient way possible. This subteam uses tools including wire
            crimper, soldering irons, and wire strippers to systemize the wiring
            board.

            Our outreach subteam is dedicated to improving the state of STEM
            education and opportunities for young people in our community
            through FIRST Robotics. From event planning to networking to
            documenting, there are several skills that members of our team
            develop in running outreach events. We strive to make a positive
            impact on our community and keep our team sustainable to guarantee
            the same quality of work for years to come. The biggest ways that we
            spread FIRST are through national conventions such as the ATIA
            conference, IMTS, and IDEAcon, as well as youth camps such as our 8+
            summer camps and fall and winter workshops we host throughout the
            year. Feel free to reference the Outreach section of our website to
            see all the ways that we promote STEM and FIRST.

            Our Manufacturing Subteam works closely with the Design Subteam to
            create the parts and systems that they design. We take the
            conceptual designs from the Design Subteam and figure out the best
            way to turn the designs into physical parts. Students learn advanced
            manufacturing principles utilising manual and CNC lathes and mills
            as well as a multitude of hand tools.
