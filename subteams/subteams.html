        On our business subteam, work is primarily concerned with collecting funding for our team. This funding allows us to organize a budget and forecast the amount that should be spent on our robot, team, and community. Annually, around 80,000 dollars is raised on our team to put towards manufacturing, wiring, programming and designing a robot to compete with; a large portion of the funding also goes towards community outreach and helping people in need. Acquiring the funding forecasted usually stems from sponsorships, fundraisers, and grants. We send letters to local businesses, set up fundraisers like chicken sales, and apply for government grants to inch us closer to our set goal. At the end of each season, we take a chunk of whatâ€™s left, and pack it away for a boost in the coming season as well. Our business subteam is full of opportunity and allows students to learn the basics of business that can be applied in the real world.
