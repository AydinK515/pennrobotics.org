            <h3>Summer Camps</h3>
            <p>
              We offer eight separate camps for students ages 1st through 8th
              grade. Skill levels differ from camp to camp, but there if your
              student is interested in STEM and robotics we most certainly have
              a camp for them!

            <h3>Junior STEM Camps</h3>
            <p>
              Junior Stem is a Penn-Harris-Madison program for students in K-5th
              grade. The goal of the program is to develop technical and
              scientific knowledge while strengthening teamwork and
              problem-solving skills.

            <p>
              We recognize that our youth STEM families are often looking for
              activities during the school year, so we created biweekly
              workshops during November and December!

            Not only do we provide students with a unique one-on-one, hands-on

            process!

            Coopertition (cooperation and competition) is a large part of
            robotics at the high school level, and we make sure we bring that
            same experience to your kids when they enroll in any of our Penn
            Robotics Youth Camps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our summer camps occur annually in June and sign-ups typically open
            around March.

        <p>
          In the camps, students work in teams to design, build and code a robot
          to complete various challenges. Each day, students are given a robot
          challenge such as lifting an object and placing in a specific
          location, completing an obstacle course, climbing an incline with
          weights, and more:
        </p>
        <li>
          Students learn about engineering principles such as torque, tension,
          and mechanics that would help with the challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the challenge is given, students are given isometric graph paper
          and asked to sketch their designs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each team discusses the best design for the robot then the students
          being to build using the VEX IQ Kits. VEX IQ Kits include a platform
          made out of a material similar to Legos, so students of all ages can
          easily build a robot and make adjustments as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          To program the robot, students use a platform similar to Scratch
          called RobotC Graphical. In the platform, students learn how to
          program a robot using a robot controller and a pre-coded program.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, each team works together to complete the challenge before
          they move to the next rotation.

              Students have the opportunity to learn how to design using 3D
              modeling software. Each student is then able to bring their
              computer model to life using our 3D printers and/or CNC laser
              cuter. Students are able to gain hands-on knowledge and experience
              with the assistance of our current high school robotics student
              mentors.

              skills to develop solutions to the challenge at hand when
