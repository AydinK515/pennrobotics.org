              For our fifth consecutive year, Penn Robotics is continuing to
              assist our community through our Mission to Engineer program. This
              initiative aims to construct assistive technology (AT) for
              individuals who don’t have the resources to acquire it themselves.

            Mission to Engineer was founded by ATMAkers and Penn Robotics in
            2017, all thanks to a family in need of assistive technology. The
            primary goal of ATMakes was to introduce those in need of Assistive
            Technology to local makers that would be willing to execute the
            project that needed to be done for the families in need. Prior to
            Mission to Engineer, Penn Robotics was one of the facilities that
            accepted the offer to help a family in need -the Hunt Family. Bill
            Binko, founder of ATMakers, first introduced Penn Robotics to the
            Hunt Family with very high expectations for the future. Upon their
            introduction, Team 135 was able to learn more about the diagnosis of
            Ella Hunt and the ways that they would be able to help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ella was diagnosed with SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy)Type 1, a
            disease that prohibits her from developing muscle. Unfortunately,
            this diagnosis means that Ella is incapable of moving on her own,
            including the movement of her vocal cords. Although Ella is
            incapable of traditional speech, she is capable of communication
            with the use of an amplification device called the Eye Gaze. She
            struggles to express herself with her peers due to the challenges
            imposed by her condition. Team 135 states that, “We are trying to
            improve the quality of her life by developing technological
            solutions to everyday problems that people overlook, the ways of
            communication and entertainment. Not only are we trying to improve
            Ella’s life, but we are trying to further fellow students’
            understanding of engineering in the real world.” Shortly after Team
            135’s initial greet with Ella and her family, they began the project
            known as Engineering Ella. This project has been featured on
            multiple different websites, including Bill Binko’s ATMakers, and
            Adafruit and is still recognized as the project that started it all.
            Our objective is to share Ella’s story and to help provide other
            families with the support they deserve.

          The goal of our Mission to Engineer program has always been to make
          connections between people in need of Assistive Technology and people
          that can help. We want to make that goal a reality by using responses
          we get from the Google Form below to connect people in need of AT to
          robotics teams and others that can help.
        </p>

          If you or someone you know is in need of AT, or if you have advice for
          our program, reach out to our team with the Google Form below.
