                Penn Robotics Mentors went to all 11 PHM elementary schools to
                mentor the Short Circuits program. Over the course of a month,
                we met 4 times to teach them how to use block codes to make a
                Sphero Bolt complete different complex exercises. This
                culminated into a final celebration in our robotics lab where
                they showcased their programs to their parents and teachers, as
                well as members of our education foundation, school board
                members, and our district’s superintendent. Following this
                program, many more of our district’s teachers and parents are
                now interested in continuing to support robotics in our schools.
                On November 4, 2022, the National Science Foundation retweeted
                Penn High School’s tweet, recognizing 135’s Short Circuits
                program. The National Science Foundation has 1.2 million
                followers on Twitter.

                local communities with our exhibition booth. We were able to
                reach out to 3873 individuals from chicago communities and
                various other parts of the nation. By bringing our FRC 2021-2022
                robot, we represented the design and manufacturing capabilities
                of our team which helped us spark conversations with national
                organizations such as NASA and HAAS. In addition to
                manufacturing capabilities we also presented the values of
                FIRST, our Mission to Engineer program, and the impact it has
                had on our community.

                To continue the tradition Penn Robotics hosted our annual summer
                camps in 2022, hosting students grades K-8th from throughout the
                school district. In our Manufacturing camp students were able to
                learn hands-on operation of machines such as mills, the CNC, and
                the laser cutter, using these in the production of a customized
                totem to take home at the end of the week. Mentors of Creativity
                challenged campers to learn key STEM concepts by competing to
                build the most stable satellites, tallest moon bases, and
                fastest rovers, ending the camp by designing their own rockets
                and launching them sky-high. Design students worked with CAD
                using Fusion, and built their own race cars to send flying down
                the air-pressure track in exciting high-speed races against
                their peers. In Software, we taught fundamental concepts of
                programming through the use of the BBC Micro Bit, exciting the
                campers by letting them watch their code come to life, including
                music and games they could play; additionally, they learned
                about electricity by creating airplane toys with working motors,
                inspiring them to continue programming and being involved with
                STEM. The second week featured our Build-a-Bot camps; these
                emulate the FIRST robotics competition in guiding kids through
                the creation, programming, and driving of either a Vex IQ or EDR
                robot in order to complete game challenges developed by the Penn
                Robotics teams. For this year’s IQ camp the challenge was called
                Lunar Launch, which included rockets robots had to fuel and
                dangerous asteroids to clear. The game for EDR was Moon Mayhem,
                featuring a spinning moon and satellite arrays that teams had to
                traverse to deliver moon rocks and gems back to their factories.

                May 21st, 2022. We introduced another area of our community to
                what robotics has to offer, and put STEM education into the
                minds of our gracious sponsors and donors of the PHM Education
                Foundation. After seeing the video we produced, the audience
                donated $17,700 to forward Short Circuits and have students as
                young as 3rd grade introduced to STEM and Robotics.

                Student representatives from our team presented at the largest
                education-tech conference in the Midwest, IDEAcon, this
                February. We reached out to hundreds of teachers and educators,
                informing them about our Penn Robotics program and how they
                might be able to implement STEM and FIRST into their
                curriculums. We also showcased our Mission to Engineer program,
                displaying prototypes and early designs of our past projects and
                explaining the history behind each. We met so many amazing
                people and made so many connections. Overall, our trip was a
                resounding success!

                Penn Robotics students traveled to Orlando, Florida to share
                information about our Mission to Engineer Program and showcase
                the projects that our ME team has completed. We had a great
                opportunity to showcase the sensory board we created for Cooper,
                a boy in our community who is faced with many obstacles when it
                comes to his learning development. The main goal of our
                presentation was to reconnect with AT professionals, such as
                Bill Binko (founder of ATMakers) and to learn more about the AT
                community. Throughout the conference and the Maker Day we
                interacted with lots of Assistive Technology professionals,
                Occupational Therapists (OT), Physical Therapists (PT),
                educators, and more. It was such an incredible opportunity for
                our ME team to make these connections and see the professional
                side of the AT industry. This event allowed our Mission to
                Engineer program to learn more about Assistive Technology and
                what path the program could take in the future.
